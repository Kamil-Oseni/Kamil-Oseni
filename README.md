A Product & UI/UX Designer with a Passion for Creating Innovative Products.

I'm a sucker for all things art — paintings, sculptures, talent, dance, the environment, and anything that screams art. When I'm not binging on cartoons or anime, you can find me rollerblading, writing, taking pictures of my surroundings, or working on a new project. 
And of course, I have a huge soft spot for dogs!......... and Dolphins!!

Art, Anime, Animals, Math, Logic & puzzles, Photography, Rollerblading, Nature, and Video Games.
